## Introduction
  
Go is an open-source programming language designed for
building simple, fast, and reliable software.
It's powerful to use and fun to learn.

This book is a hands-on introduction to Go. It gives you
the tools you need to understand the why of Go and how to
write real Go programs.

### Intended Audience

This book is intended for experienced programmers who may
be new to Go. If you have previous experience with
languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript, C#, or Java, you
should find this book immediately approachable even if
this is your first introduction to Go. Even if you've
worked with Go before, you may find that the material
covers ideas and techniques that you haven't seen
elsewhere.

### An Example-Based Approach

Programmers learn to program by writing programs.
_Go by Example_ therefore teaches Go exclusively via
working example programs, with each chapter trying to
provide the programmer a new tool for writing her own
programs.
