<h2>Introduction</h2>
  
<p>Go is an open-source programming language designed for
   building simple, fast, and reliable software. It's
   powerful to use and fun to learn.</p>

<p>This book is a hands-on introduction to Go. It gives
   you the tools you need to understand the why of Go and
   how to write real Go programs.</p>


<h3>Intended Audience</h3>

<p>This book is intended for experienced programmers who
   may be new to Go. If you have previous experience with
   languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript, C#, or Java,
   you should find this book immediately approachable even
   if this is your first introduction to Go. Even if
   you've worked with Go before, you may find that the
   material covers ideas and techniques that you haven't
   seen elsewhere.</p>


<h3>An Example-Based Approach</h3>

<p>We believe that programmers learn to program by writing
   programs. <i>Go by Example</i> therefore teaches Go
   exclusively via working example programs, with each
   chapter trying to provide the programmer a new tool for
   writing her own programs.</p>
